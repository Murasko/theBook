# Functions
Rust uses *snake case* for function and variable names - all lowercase and underscore between different words.

We start a function by `fn` followed by a name and params. The curly brackets tell rust where the functions body begins and ends.

Rust doesn't care where you define your functions, only that they are defined in a scope the caller can see.

Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
Expressions evaluate to a resultant value. Letâ€™s look at some examples.
